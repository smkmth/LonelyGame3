  TextToDisplay: "June 12th, 1943\r\n\nIt is his eighteenth birthday today. So now
    he knows what he is.\r\n\nI hope that the years of his life have been blessed,
    that he has lived a normal life with the worries of a normal child. That is all
    I can hope for, and I can be glad knowing he has not had to live in this place,
    where the walls talk and our minds never work the way we want them to. I can barely
    remember the wrinkles of his newborn face, but still I love him more than anything
    else in this world.\n\r\nHappy Birthday, Arthur.\r\n"
