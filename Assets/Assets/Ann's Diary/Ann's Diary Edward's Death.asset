  TextToDisplay: "September 20th, 1945\r\n\nIt\u2019s been happening for a couple
    of weeks now.\n\r\nWhat a fool I was, to think I would be any different. Edward
    told me, just before he left: \u201CIf I die, Luther will be your burden: a part
    of who you are, and who you will be. It is the fate of every Cantwell, and it
    will be yours as well.\u201D\n\r\nAnd he was right. I hear him, Luther, our founder,
    worming his way into my thoughts. He has started nudging me, telling me I should
    be doing things for him. Today, I was in the reading room, when he instructed
    me to push my grandmother\u2019s vase off the mantelpiece. I lost my wits for
    a second, blinked, and there it was on the floor, shattered to smithereens.\n\r\n\u201CDo
    NOT clean it up,'' he said.\r"
