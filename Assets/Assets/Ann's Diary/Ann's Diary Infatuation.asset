  TextToDisplay: "October 5th, 1945\r\n\nClara. What a darling she is.\n \r\nI have
    not really talked to her for years - the estate is big enough that we rarely need
    to see each other - but now I feel oddly drawn to her, like a moth to a flame,
    magnetised to the light in her eyes. I always see her in the reading room, but
    I am rather afraid of talking to her. There\u2019s a hole in the wall on the west
    side, behind an old painting, so I watch her from there sometimes. She likes to
    sip whiskey, always leaving her glass and bottle next to her chair.\n\r\nLuther,
    oddly, is quite encouraging of my new infatuation. He said I should dine with
    Clara tomorrow (we usually dine alone). I see no reason why I shouldn\u2019t -
    it seems a rather benign request. \r\n\nI will find the courage to ask her tomorrow."
