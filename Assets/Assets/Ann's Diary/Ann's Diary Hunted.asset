  TextToDisplay: "I do not know what day it is...\r\n\nLuther did not like it, me
    trying to unveil his secret. And now, now the house is wringing my memories dry.
    I opened the gate, and I walked through the door that was waiting there. I do
    not remember anything after that. I am somewhere below, in a damp room. There
    are things crawling over my legs, slithering across my shoulders. I have not eaten
    in two days.\n\r\nLuther lectures me. He says that the curse cannot be broken,
    that the house would  never allow it. He says that we Cantwells, we have no choice
    in the matter of how to live our lives. I will be dead soon, he says.\n \r\nI
    think the walls are closing in.\r"
