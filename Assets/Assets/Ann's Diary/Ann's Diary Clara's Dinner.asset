  TextToDisplay: "October 10th, 1945 /n It was a perfect evening.  We cooked together,
    ate together, laughed together. But then there was a lull, a gap that opened in
    our conversation, one that he - Luther - used to wedge himself between us. He
    said: \u201CWhy not invite her to the library, show her that book you love?\u201D
    We sat down on the sofas overlooking the library, and we opened it up: Tales From
    The Moor it is called. She began reading, and I was entranced by the slightest
    movements of her lips. As she came to the end the delight in her eyes tore at
    my heart, the surprise on her brow filled me with adoration. That is when it happened,
    when he said \u201Ckiss her\u201D, and I obeyed.  She\u2026 well she was disgusted.
    She retreated from me on the sofa, slid to her feet... But she could not leave.
    That\u2019s what he kept saying. He kept saying it, over and over. I tried to
    stop her, tugging at her arm as she pulled away. Before I knew it she was running
    out of the west exit on the first floor. I caught up with her as she reached the
    Foyer balcony. My arm reached out for her, a supplicating arm, begging her to
    stop, telling her that it was all just a misunderstanding. But instead a stoker
    materialised in my hand, impaling itself in her skull. The sight of her lifeless
    body crashing through the bannister is seared into my mind. This was all Luther\u2019s
    doing. I had allowed his will to sneak up on me. I have to stop this.  "
