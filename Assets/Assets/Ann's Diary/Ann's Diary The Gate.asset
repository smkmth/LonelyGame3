  TextToDisplay: "November 15th, 1945\r\n\nToday I was told by my great aunt that
    she had once opened the gate in the library. I remember, as a child, being told
    to stay away. My father told everyone: \u201CIf any of you see what is behind
    there, your eyes will glaze over, your mouth will be sewn shut, and the very walls
    will squeeze the memories from your skull, like juice from a cherry.\u201D\n\r\nWhatever
    is behind there, I think it is time to unveil it, no matter the cost.\r"
