  TextToDisplay: "October 24th, 1945\n\nHe is not happy with me. He thinks I am overreacting.
    Why would I give up immortality for the sake of a minor tragedy? \u201CCantwell\u2019s
    die all the time,\u201D he says, \u201Cbut they always find a way back\u201D.
    He says the house is getting impatient, whatever that means.\r\n\nI cannot afford
    to listen to him. I am on his trail, and he knows it. I have found reference to
    a memoir that he was writing in the years leading up to his death, the contents
    of which elude me. \n\r\nBut I will press on; the answer to ending this curse
    must be in those pages.  \r"
