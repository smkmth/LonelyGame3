  TextToDisplay: "Chapter Four\n\r\nDispelling Spirits from Your Home\r\n\n...Spirits
    are usually benign creatures, tormented by something in their life that tethers
    them to the corporeal realm, keeping them from the loving embrace of Our Heavenly
    Father. \r\n\nIf you have a spirit in your home, making things go bump in the
    night, you need only find its Tether. Take this to a place of God, and pray for
    the soul of the spirit. That should be enough to give them peace, and allow them
    to go freely to the Kingdom of Heaven.\r"
