  TextToDisplay: "Dear Mr Roberts\r\n\nI hope you are pleased with your new Aetherean
    device. I must again express my deepest condolences regarding the tragic loss
    of your wife. To reiterate, using this device, and the film I have included, you
    will be able to take pictures of her spirit around the house.\n\r\nIf she is close
    to you, a counter will begin ticking: the closer she is, the faster the ticking
    will be. Once you know she is close, just raise the view-finder, like I showed
    you. It may take a few tries to catch her, there is no indication as to what direction
    she will be in. I am afraid that is something I am still working on\u2026\r\n\nYours
    Sincerely\n\r\nEdward Cantwell\r"
