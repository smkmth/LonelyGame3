  TextToDisplay: 25th October, 1814 I was taking pictures of the house today, and
    I noticed a strange figure in one of the pictures which I am sure was not there
    before. A ghost, perhaps? I did not do anything differently, just pressed the
    capture trigger (LMB), same as usual, and there it was.
