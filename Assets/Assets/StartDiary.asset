  TextToDisplay: "Dearest Brother\r\n\nIf you\u2019re reading this, then I am dead.\r\n\nYou
    are now the proud owner of the Cantwell estate. I have told you in the past about
    my family, their strange misdeeds. But what I have not told you, dear brother,
    is that my family - the Cantwell family - is cursed. \r\n\nAbout twenty years
    ago, the last surviving Cantwell, my aunt, Ann, died. It was then that I began
    to hear him, our founder, Luther, whispering in my ear: giving me instructions,
    making demands, tightening his grip on both my mind and body. Over time, my family
    joined him, their voices battling with each other in my head. I have been living
    with them like this for twenty years, twenty years William.\r\n\nNow, before you
    burn the estate to the ground, or sell it - lord knows no one will want that place
    - you should know that the curse is very much alive. We are all dead, yes, but
    that does not mean we are at rest. The curse will return us to the Cantwell estate,
    and keep us there, trapped, in some form or another.\n\nThat is why I have left
    you the estate; to go there, and end this curse. Only then will I be free. \r\n\nPlease
    William, grant me this dead man\u2019s wish.\r\n\nArthur\r\n"
