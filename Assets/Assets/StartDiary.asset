  TextToDisplay: "My Dearest William,\r\n\nI know it has been a while since we last
    spoke, and I am sorry for the lack of correspondence between us these past two
    years. The duties of a husband has left little time for our dalliances it seems.
    But William, you have to know that you are never far from my mind.\r\n\nIt has
    been nigh impossible for me to get away from the estate; and believe me William,
    I would leave if I could. This house, it toys with my disposition, gripping me
    for days on end with a fever of the spirit. I have read some stories, fragments
    really, about the Cantwell\x19s and their bizarre fates within these halls. But
    alas, Isobel is not very forthcoming with information regarding her family, especially
    her parents.\n\nPerhaps they no longer exist in her mind: there are doctors who
    say that tragedy can do that to a person. \r\nBut I digress, I am writing this
    letter because I want to see you again. You are hereby cordially invited to the
    Cantwell estate. I have told Isobel all about you, apart from those details best
    left locked away. You know the ones I mean.\r\n\nArrive whenever it suits you,
    we are not going anywhere.\r\n\nLove\r\nCassian\r\n"
