  TextToDisplay: "October 12th, 1945\r\nEdward\u2019s dead. They came this morning,
    some men in army fatigues.\r\nAs they were speaking, all I could imagine was my
    last conversation with him. We were in the library, perched on the sofas overlooking
    the Cantwell\u2019s vast collection. We were reading Tales From the Moor. We obsess
    over that thing, its stories of magic, faeries and monsters, each one more delightful
    than the last. \r\nHe\u2019d told me then, his brow creased in despair: \u201CWhen
    I die, Luther will be your burden: a part of who you are and who you will be.
    But Ann... You must not let him take you as he has taken me.\u201D\r\nAnd now\u2026
    I\u2019m beginning to hear him - a fog pooling at the back of my skull - which
    means, if my research is correct, that now is my only chance to end him. If I\u2019m
    going to do this, I\u2019ll have to do it soon\u2026\r\n\n"
