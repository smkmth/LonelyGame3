    Edward''s dead. They came this morning, some men in army fatigues.


    As they were speaking, their words morphed into Edward''s last. We were in the
    library, perched on the sofas in front of the fireplace. We were reading Tales
    From the Moor, a book we had always obsessed over. Whenever he was himself, we
    would sit down and find new delights in those pages, its tales of faeries, magic
    and monsters.


    We had been laughing at something, something that wasn''t really funny at all.
    His brow had creased suddenly, the laughter had caught in his throat. He said:
    "Ann... You must know that when I die, Luther will be your burden. He will eat
    away at your memories, and you will have to fight him every day, for every second
    you want to be yourself."


    I had hoped I would have longer to prepare. But now... I''m beginning to hear
    him - a fog pooling at the back of my skull. I think it is already too late.'
