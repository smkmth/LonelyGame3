    Edward''s dead. They came this morning, some men in army fatigues.


    As they were speaking, their words morphed into Edward''s last. We were in the
    library, perched on the sofas in front of the fireplace. We were reading Tales
    From the Moor. We always obsessed over that thing, when he was more himself: its
    stories of magic, faeries and monsters. We''d always find new delights in those
    pages, no matter where we looked...


    We had been laughing at something, something that wasn''t really funny at all.
    His brow had creased suddenly, the laughter had caught in his throat. He said:
    "When I die, Luther will be your burden: a part of who you are and who you will
    be. You will fight him every day, for every second that you want to be yourself."


    I had hoped I would have longer to prepare. But now... I''m beginning to hear
    him - a fog pooling at the back of my skull. I think it''s already too late.'
