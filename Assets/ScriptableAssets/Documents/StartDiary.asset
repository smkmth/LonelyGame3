  TextToDisplay: 'Dear Horace


    I have a new lead for you to investigate, and from the sounds of it, this is not
    your run-of-the-mill ghost story. A couple of days ago, we received a letter from
    the recently deceased Arthur Cantwell.


    He talks about Luther, a spirit that has haunted his family for centuries, stealing
    their minds and bodies until both are lost forever. Arthur was under the impression
    that his ancestors, Luther''s past victims, will still be roaming the Cantwell
    estate, trapped between our world and the next. He wants us to find their spirits,
    and free them if possible.


    For this investigation you will have our new Aperture device at your disposal,
    which can capture still images of paranormal phenomena. If you need to remind
    yourself of how it works, check the User Manual, which you should have on your
    person.


    I know this is your first contract. Horace, but all of us here at the NYPR believe
    in your ability.


    Good luck
