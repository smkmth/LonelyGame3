  TextToDisplay: 'Dear Horace


    I have a new contract for you - not your usual run-of-the-mill ghost story, I
    can assure you. We received a letter from one Arthur Cantwell, part of which reads
    as follows:


    "The Cantwell family rose to power through Luther, our elusive and enigmatic master.
    It is through him that our lives begin, and end. Each owner of the Cantwell estate,
    upon the death of the last, becomes a host for Luther; he erodes their memories
    and steals their identity, until eventually he decides what form to take. I ahve
    endured his presence longer than most others in my family, but even I could not
    withstand him forever"


    Arthur is under the impression that his family, although dead, may still be roaming
    the estate, trapped between our world and the next. He wants us to find their
    spirits, and free them if possible.


    You remember how to do that, right?
