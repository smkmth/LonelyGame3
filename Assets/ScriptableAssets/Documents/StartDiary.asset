  TextToDisplay: 'Dearest Brother


    If you''re reading this, I''m dead; and you''re probably wondering where you are.


    You''re cold, damp, finding it difficult to see clearly through all the dust and
    darkness... But it''s not as bad as it seems. In fact, you should rejoice, for
    you are now the proud owner of the Cantwell estate.


    "The waht estate?" you may ask; "Who are these Cantwells?" you may be wondering.
    Well - and this may come as a surprise - I''m not actually your brother; at least,
    not by blood. This place, the Cantwell estate, this is where I was born.


    I''ve left you my family''s prized possession - the Aperture device - which you
    should find on your person. You''ll be able to see things not usually reserved
    for the eyes of the living. It will tick occasionally, and become more frequent
    when there''s something... not-quite-normal about your surroundings. What that
    is, well, you''ll have to find out for yourself. But let''s just say there''s
    a little ''spring cleaning'' to do.


    Good luck, and stay safe.


    Arthur.


    P.S. Listen to the house.'
