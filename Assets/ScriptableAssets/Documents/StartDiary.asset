  TextToDisplay: "Dearest Brother\r\nIf you\u2019re reading this, I\u2019m dead; and
    you\u2019re probably wondering where you are. \r\nYou\u2019re probably cold, damp,
    finding it difficult to see clearly through all the dust and darkness\u2026 But
    don\u2019t worry! You\u2019re quite safe for the moment. In fact, you should rejoice!
    You are now the proud owner of the Cantwell estate.\r\n\u201CThe what estate?\u201D
    you may ask; \u201CWho are these Cantwell people?\u201D you may be wondering.
    Put simply, William, those people are I, and this estate is mine. \r\nYes, yes,
    you\u2019re confused. We\u2019re family, are we not? Not so, I\u2019m afraid.
    I was born here, in this house, a true Cantwell... and so I will remain. My mother,
    naive as she was, thought that she could save me by sending me away; you know,
    to live with a normal family, who lived normally and died normally like normal
    people were supposed to\u2026 A family like yours.\r\nBut that\u2019s all in the
    past. Now you\u2019re here, and I\u2019m \u201Cdead\u201D, but not perhaps in
    the way you\u2019re used to. You\u2019ve got a lot of work ahead of you. You\u2019ll
    realise as you walk around that there\u2019s - how do I put this? - a little spring
    cleaning to do. Don\u2019t worry, you\u2019ll find everything you need.The house
    will provide.\r\nOh, and one last thing: pay very close attention to the house.
    \ It\u2019s not used to having a normal person around. It\u2019s been a while,
    you see, and it\u2019s gotten into some bad habits, become quite temperamental.
    But I\u2019m sure you can handle it.\r\nGood luck, and I\u2019ll see you soon.\r\nArthur.\r\n"
