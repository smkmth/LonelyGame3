  TextToDisplay: "Another Life I Sought to Contrive\nBy Luther Cantwell\n\nHere, another
    life I sought to contrive,\nIn an old house with a mist for a name:\nI stride
    inside and unbidden survive.\n\nHand shaking, quill poised, the tip takes a dive,\nIts
    voice humming, spilling sense meant to tame:\nHere, another life I sought to contrive.\n\nNaked
    in the sheets, waiting for hours five;\nA breath escapes him, and despite the
    shame,\nI stride inside and unbidden survive.\n\nAmong the workers, the bees in
    the hive, \nWe dug for death, until we lost our flame:\nHere, another life I sought
    to contrive.\n\nThe world's history lay in my archive;\nFor one page - a summons
    it did proclaim -\nI stride inside and unbidden survive.\n\nOf life I seek for
    myself to deprive;\nBut as the dawn births me upon the moor:\nHere, another life
    I seek to contrive,\nI stride inside and unbidden survive. "
