  TextToDisplay: "Here, another life I sought to contrive,\r\nIn an old house with
    a mist for a name:\r\nI stride inside and unbidden survive.\r\nHand shaking, quill
    poised, the tip takes a dive,\r\nIts voice humming, spilling sense meant to tame:\r\nHere,
    another life I sought to contrive.\r\nNaked in the sheets, waiting for hours five;\r\nA
    breath escapes him, and despite the shame,\r\nI stride inside and unbidden survive.\r\nAmong
    the workers, the bees in the hive,\r\nWe dug for death, until we lost our flame:\r\nHere,
    another life I sought to contrive.\r\nThe world\u2019s history lay in my archive;\r\nFor
    one page - a summons it did proclaim -\r\nI stride inside and unbidden survive.\r\nOf
    life I seek for myself to deprive;\r\nBut as the dawn births me upon the moor:\r\nHere,
    another life I seek to contrive,\r\nI stride inside and unbidden survive.\r\n\r\n\r\n"
