  TextToDisplay: 'The Aperture device functions much like a camera, except for one
    small difference: it can capture still images of paranormal phenomena - spirits
    for example. Quite simly raise the viewfinder (RMB) and press the shutter release
    button (LMB) when you believe the spirit to be in view. You can see the amount
    of film you have left in a cartridge in the viewfinder, and you will have to reload
    a new cartridge (R) once you have run out of film.


    The device also has a proximity sensor attached. It is a geiger counter of sorts,
    and the closer you are to paranormal phenomena, the faster the counter will tick.
    There is no directional indicator at the moment, but we are experimenting with
    solutions.


    Note: this device is not a weapon, so if a spirit is hostile, use the device to
    keep sight of it and avoid it all costs.
