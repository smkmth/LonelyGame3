  TextToDisplay: "Chapter Four\r\nDispelling Spirits from Your Home\r\nPeople are
    often terrified by the thought of a spirit roaming the Earth, but it need not
    be so. It is a lot simpler than people think, dispelling a spirit, and there is
    rarely any threat or danger involved. Spirits are usually benign creatures, tormented
    by something in their life that tethers them to the corporeal realm, keeping them
    from the loving embrace of Our Heavenly Father. \r\nIf you have a spirit in your
    home, making things go bump in the night, you need only find its Tether. Take
    this to a place of God, and pray for the soul of the spirit. That should be enough
    to give them peace, and allow them to go freely to the Kingdom of Heaven.\r\n\u2026\r\n"
