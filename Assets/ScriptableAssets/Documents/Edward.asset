    When Edward left me to fight in the war, I was overjoyed. For the first time in
    years, Luther was gone, that spirit that has plagued this family for so long...
    Gone, nestled in the mind of my husband.


    But now the house is waking up. Things are starting to move again: the floorboards
    creak, the walls groan, and a quill flourishes into the early hours of the morning.
    It''s preparing for him, making sure everything is in place for its master''s
    return.


    I can''t face it, that man who looks like my husband but moves as someone else.
    I want things to stay as they are, where he is away, the house asleep, and I''m
    as free as I could ever be in this damned, accursed place.


    I know it''s too much to ask.
