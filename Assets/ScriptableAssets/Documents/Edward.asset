  TextToDisplay: "September 20th, 1945\r\nThey say the war is coming to a close, which
    means Edward will return soon.\r\nWhen he left, he took Luther with him, nestled
    in his head, and the house fell quiet.\r\nI don\u2019t want him to come back.
    I don\u2019t want him to see me again, for the house to be alive and awake, tracing
    my every step. I want things to stay like this, in this - this limbo, where I
    can exist without fear.\r\nI can hear it waking up; the floorboards creaking,
    the walls groaning. The house: it knows just as I do, we won\u2019t be alone much
    long\r\n"
