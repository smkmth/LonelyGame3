  TextToDisplay: "OI\u2019ve lost track of the days...\r\nI can\u2019t find it. Whatever
    it is I\u2019m looking for, I can\u2019t imagine it any more. He keeps telling
    me, Luther, to give up, that I\u2019m not the first to try and end him, and that
    I won\u2019t be the last.\r\n\u201CWe never learn,\u201D he says.\r\nIt angers
    him, and as his anger swells so do the walls. They swell until I can barely breathe\u2026
    And then I back off the way I came, to calm him down. It works, for the most part,
    but he grows impatient. I don\u2019t know how many more chances I have left.\r\n\u201CThis
    is your last chance,\u201D he says.\r\nThat settles it, I suppose.\r\n\n"
