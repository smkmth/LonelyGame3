    I hear him all the time; each day I feel his voice edging me out, stealing my
    thoughts and discarding them as he pleases. My actions are barely my own: I''ll
    blink and find myself somewhere else, with no recollection of how I got there.


    Every breath brings with it another lungful of pain, as though I were drowning
    endlessly, the depths black and unyielding around me.


    It won''t be long now, until I''m his.'
