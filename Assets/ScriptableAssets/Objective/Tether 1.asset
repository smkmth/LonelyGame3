  objectiveString: Luther, some sort of spirit, appears to have been possessing Ann;
    and from the sounds of it, she was close to losing her battle. She was trying
    to get to the library, to find that book again - 'Tales From the Moor' - before
    she died. If she is the spirit haunting the estate, then that book must be her
    Tether.
  objectiveName: Find Ann's Tether and release her.
