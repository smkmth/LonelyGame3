  objectiveString: 'I''m now inside the Cantwell estate, and yes, I do remember how
    to free spirits: I''ll have to find their ''Tether'', an item of great importance
    to the individual during their lifetime, and then perform a ritual prayer in a
    place of God. That''s how it works in theory, at least. Truth be told, being a
    new recruit and all, I''ve never had to deal with a spirit before...'
  objectiveName: Search for clues regarding any spirits and their Tethers
