  objectiveString: I've found a book called 'Spirits in the Mortal Realm'. A page
    was bookmarked, and it talked about the process required for releasing spirits.
    Perhaps this is what Arthur meant? If there are spirits here - and I wouldn't
    be surprised - I'll have to find the spirit's 'Tether', and then find somewhere
    to 'pray for its soul'. A Chapel, perhaps?
  objectiveName: Find the spirit's Tether and return it to the Chapel
