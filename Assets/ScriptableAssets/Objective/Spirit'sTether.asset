  objectiveString: I've found a book called Spirits in the Mortal Realm. It says that
    I can release spirits by taking their 'Tether' (an item of great importance to
    them) to the Chapel and 'praying for their soul'. If there is a spirit around
    here, I should keep that in mind.
  objectiveName: Find the spirit's Tether and release them
