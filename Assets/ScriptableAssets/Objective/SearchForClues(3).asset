  objectiveString: I've found a Chapel, and a beautiful one at that. I suppose this
    fits the descriptiuon for a 'place of God' so if I find any Tethers for the spirits
    roaming the estate, bringing them back here should allow me to cleanse the estate
    of their presence.
  objectiveName: Search for clues regarding any spirits and their Tethers
