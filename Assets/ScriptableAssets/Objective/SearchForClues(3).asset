  objectiveString: I've found a Chapel. I suppose this fits the description for a
    'place of God'. Once I've found a Tether, I should bring it back here before performing
    the ritual prayer. If I'm correct, this will cleanse the house of the spirit's
    presence linked to the Tether.
  objectiveName: Search for clues regarding any spirits and their Tethers
