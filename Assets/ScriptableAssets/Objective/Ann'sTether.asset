  objectiveString: 'From what I can gather, as Luther took control of Ann, he transformed
    her into an ethereal form. "I pick up the quill only to see it slip through my
    fingers": that''s what she had said. I''ve never ehard anything like it. Usually
    spirits are the fragmented remains of the dead, but Ann, from what I can tell,
    never really ''died'', but rather she transitioned from one state of being into
    another. I have to assume her spirit adeheres to the same rules as all others,
    right? I''ll have to find her ''Tether'' if I''m going to find out. She mentions
    searching for a book... What was it called again?'
  objectiveName: Find Ann's Tether and release her spirit
